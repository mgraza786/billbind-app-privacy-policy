# Privacy Policy for BillBind

**Last updated:** December 02, 2025

BillBind ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by BillBind.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. SMS Messages (Financial Transactions)
Our app requests permission to read your SMS messages (`READ_SMS`).
-   **Purpose:** This is strictly used to automatically detect and extract financial transaction details (amount, merchant, date) from bank notifications.
-   **Processing:** This processing happens **locally on your device**. We do not upload your raw SMS messages to any server. Only the extracted transaction data (which you can view and edit) is saved to your account.

### B. Account Information
When you register, we collect your email address and a password to create your account.

### C. Financial Data
We store the transaction data (Income, Expenses) that you manually add or that is automatically generated from your SMS. This data is synced to our secure cloud database (Firebase) to allow you to access it across devices and share it with your group.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
-   To provide the core functionality of the app (tracking your budget).
-   To sync your data across devices.
-   To allow you to share your budget with other users you explicitly join a group with.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not sell your personal data. Your data is shared only in the following circumstances:
-   **With your Group:** If you join a "Group" or "Family" within the app, other members of that group can see the transactions you add.
-   **Service Providers:** We use Google Firebase for data hosting and authentication.

## 4. Security
We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest.

## 5. Contact Us
