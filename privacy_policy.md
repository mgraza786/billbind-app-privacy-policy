BillBind ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by BillBind.

1. Information We Collect
A. SMS Messages (Financial Transactions)
Our app requests permission to read your SMS messages (READ_SMS).

Purpose: This is strictly used to automatically detect and extract financial transaction details (amount, merchant, date) from bank notifications.
Processing: This processing happens locally on your device. We do not upload your raw SMS messages to any server. Only the extracted transaction data (which you can view and edit) is saved to your account.
B. Account Information
When you register, we collect your email address and a password to create your account.

C. Financial Data
We store the transaction data (Income, Expenses) that you manually add or that is automatically generated from your SMS. This data is synced to our secure cloud database (Firebase) to allow you to access it across devices and share it with your group.

Service Providers: We use third-party services to facilitate our Service:
Google Firebase: For authentication and real-time database hosting.
Firebase Crashlytics & Google Analytics: To monitor app stability and performance. These services may collect data such as device identifiers, crash logs, and usage data.
